An Atari 2600 game kernel by Jason H. Moore, PhD. hanks to Andrew Davie, Darrel Spice, and many others who provided numerous examples and tutorials that I learned from. I used this kernel in my game GeneMedic at http//genemedic.org.

This assembly language code stepts through the main parts of an Atari 2600 program which is closely tied to the special features of the hardware. For more information see https://atariprojects.org/2023/12/23/learn-to-program-games-for-the-atari-2600-in-6502-assembly-language-1-3-months/
